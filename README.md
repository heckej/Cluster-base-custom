# P&O Entrepreneurship - Team A - Virtual Company Assistant (code) a.k.a Cluster
## About this project
This is the code base repository of our bachelor's thesis project. The chatbot and its helper services depend on (and thereforeall communicate with) the Cluster Connector Server, to which a connection is established using the `cluster-connector` (Python connector) or `ClusterClient` (C#/.NET connector) libraries. All connector related code can be found in the [Cluster Connector repository](https://github.com/heckej/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-ClusterConnector).
