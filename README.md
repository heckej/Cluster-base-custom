# P&O Entrepreneurship - Team A - Virtual Company Assistant (code) a.k.a Cluster
## About this project
This is the code base repository of our bachelor's thesis project. The chatbot and its helper services depend on (and therefore all communicate with) the Cluster Connector Server, to which a connection is established using the `cluster-connector` (Python connector) or `ClusterClient` (C#/.NET Core connector) libraries. All connector related code can be found in the [Cluster Connector repository](https://github.com/heckej/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-ClusterConnector).

## Documentation
Documentation can be found at [Clusterdocs](https://heckej.github.io/P-O-Entrepreneurship-Team-A-ClusterConnector/).
